# Case Study: Equifax Data Breach (2017)

I, **Subhadra Mahanta**, completed this case study as my Capstone Project for the **Postgraduate Program in Cybersecurity by MIT xPRO (2024â€“2025).**

## Overview
This study explores how an **unpatched Apache server** and a **lax approach to security best practices** led to the compromise of sensitive data belonging to over **140 million U.S. citizens**.  

The case highlights the critical importance of:
- Regular patching and audits  
- Security best practices at multiple organizational levels  
- Adoption of frameworks such as **NIST**, **Zero Trust Architecture**, **Defense in Depth** and more.

## Project Objective
The Equifax breach is a reminder of why **security must begin at the grassroots level** and why **regular audits are uncompromisable**.  

In this project, I analyzed the event in detail, identified failures, and proposed **mitigation strategies** that could have reduced the impact or even prevented the breach.
